Therefore the CO2e per 100g of beans = $a + c \times$ (the weight of beans)$^(-1/3)$ Use the maximum and minimum weights from the Tesco table to fit the values for $a$ and $c$ gives $c = (110-150) / (0.106 - 0.17) = 625$ and $a = 150 - c * 0.17 = 150 - 625 * 0.17 = 44$. So this means the beans contribute 44 gCO2e per 100g beans and the can contributes the rest e.g. for the 420g can of beans it contributes 86g CO2e /100g of beans, or 360g CO2e for the whole can. i.e. 2/3 of the CO2e %}]",0,0.0,0.0,100,Grams,,Packaging,0,,,,Dummy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dummy,Dummy,1,Dummy,1,Dummy,Dummy
